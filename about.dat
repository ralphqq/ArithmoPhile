{"description": "ArithmoPhile is a simple, no-frills app that helps you practice and sharpen your mental arithmetic skills. It generates an endless supply of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions, allowing you to get all the arithmetic workout you need. Plus, the problems come in three levels of difficulty, so that you can fully enjoy the app regardless of the numeric proficiency you're currently in. The app maker strongly suggests that you do the computations purely in your head, without the aid of paper/pen or calculators. For best results, use ArithmoPhile everyday." ,"website": "ralphqq.github.io", "license": "ArithmoPhile is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nArithmoPhile is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
