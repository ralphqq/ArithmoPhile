## ArithmoPhile
ArithmoPhile is a simple, no-frills app that helps you practice and sharpen your mental arithmetic skills. It generates an endless supply of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions, allowing you to get all the arithmetic workout you need. Plus, the problems come in three levels of difficulty, so that you can fully enjoy the app regardless of the numeric proficiency you're currently in.

The app maker strongly suggests that you do the computations purely in your head, without the aid of paper/pen or calculators. For best results, use ArithmoPhile everyday.

## Dependencies
This app is built with and runs on [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/). Because of some noted problems when [installing wxPython from the requirements.txt file](https://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython) and possible issues when [running wxPython in a virtual environment](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14141431/cant-use-wxpython-in-virtualenv), you should [read the installation guide](https://wiki.wxpython.org/How%20to%20install%20wxPython) to find out how to properly install it, as well as go over this tutorial to fix problems when [using wxPython in a virtual environment](http://codersbuffet.blogspot.com/2009/09/wxpython-in-virtualenv.html).

## Usage
To run the app, cd to the project root directory and enter `python main.py` on the command line.

## Contributing
Please let me know any comments or suggestions. I wrote this code quite a long time ago and only made minor changes before pushing it here, so there's really some room for improvement.

Also, one particular area you might want to improve on is how levels of difficulty are applied in the app. I simply set them in a totally arbitrary way and may not truly reflect how arithmetic questions are actually supposed to increase in difficulty in practice.
